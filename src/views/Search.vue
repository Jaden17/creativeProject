    <h1>Safety</h1>
    <p>The organic chemistry laboratory has the potential to be very dangerous. This is why it is extremely important that you follow all safety guidelines when you are in the laboratory. As an ethical chemistry laboratory student you must make sure that you understand and follow all safety precautions. Ignoring safety precautions may result in a serious injury to yourself or another student. Any student working in an unsafe manner is a danger to other students and will be asked to leave the laboratory. Always adhere to the following safety guidelines:
    </p>
    <p>1. Wear eye protection. Chemicals can cause serious damage to your eyes, including blindness. To prevent chemicals and other hazardous substances from coming in contact with your eyes, safety glasses or goggles must be worn at all times you or someone else is working in the laboratory. (If you must adjust or clean your eye protection, step outside of the laboratory to do so.) Goggles offer the best protection and are particularly recommended to guard against splashes and explosions.
    </p>
    <p>2. Dress appropriately for lab. The less skin that is exposed, the better! Sandals are not allowed in the laboratory because they expose your toes to chemical spills and broken glassware. Shoes must be close-toed and offer the best protection when they are made from a non-porous material. Long-sleeved shirts/blouses and long pants are recommended. If you choose to wear a shirt that exposes your midriff, you must wear a lab coat. Lab coats are also recommended to protect clothing you value. Avoid loose-fitting clothing and accessories (e.g., scarves, ties, long necklaces, etc.) because they may cause spills or come in contact with hazardous chemicals. Hair that is longer than shoulder length must be tied back.
    </p>
    <p>3. Wear appropriate gloves. Gloves are required at all times when you are handling chemicals and items that have been exposed to chemicals. Keep in mind that different gloves protect against different types of chemicals. However, once you have gloves on, this does not mean that you are free to touch everything! For example, you do not want to rub your eye with a gloved hand once you have handled chemicals. A good rule of thumb is to not touch anything with your gloves that you do not want chemicals on. Obtain a new pair of gloves if they develop a rip or tear.
    </p>
    <p>4. Keep the lab clean and neat. Avoid cluttering the lab bench or hood. Clutter can lead to spills, so return items promptly to their proper locations. Do not place personal items, such as and backpacks, on the floor as they may cause others to trip. Promptly notify the laboratory instructor of any spills and clean them up as instructed. Spills must be cleaned up as soon as possible to prevent others from exposure to the spilled chemical. Inform the laboratory instructor of any conditions that seem unsafe.
    </p>
    <p>5. Perform only authorized experiments. Unauthorized experimentation may expose you and your lab mates to unforeseen hazards.
    </p>
    <p>6. Do not work alone. Always have someone present in the laboratory that knows what to do in the event of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>7. Treat all laboratory reagents as if they are hazardous. Often, not all hazards are known about a chemical you may be working with, so always use maximum precautions. If you spill a chemical on your skin, immediately rinse it with water, and then notify your laboratory instructor. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap or detergent before leaving the laboratory, even if you wear gloves. Appropriate labels on the reagent bottles will often indicate special hazards.
    </p>
    <p>8. Store and dispose of laboratory reagents as directed. Pay careful attention to the lab manual and to your instructor on how to store and dispose of reagents. For example, some reagents are extremely flammable and must be stored in a flammable cabinet when not in use. Other reagents must be kept away from chemicals that they are incompatible with. Many reagents cannot be disposed of down the drain as they may be toxic to the environment. If you are instructed to use a waste container for disposal of a reagent, insure the waste container is closed after you are finished to prevent exposure to noxious fumes. Promptly notify the laboratory instructor of any spills and clean them up as instructed. Spills must be cleaned up as soon as possible to prevent others from being exposed to the spilled chemical.
    </p>
    <p>9. Know how to transport chemicals safely. If you must transport a chemical outside of the laboratory, the chemical must be in a closed container (i.e., no open beakers). Additionally, large bottles and particularly hazardous chemicals must be transported in a safety carrier.
    </p>
    <p>10. Do not bring food, drinks, or cosmetics into the laboratory. Eating, drinking, or applying cosmetics in the laboratory can introduce toxic or corrosive chemicals into your system. You particularly want to avoid any contamination to your mouth or eyes.
    </p>
    <p>11. Immediately report all incidents to the laboratory instructor. An incident is any injury or situation that might result in an injury. The laboratory instructor will best know how to handle the situation and may also use the information you provide to help other students avoid a similar difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>12. Know the location and use of all safety equipment. All laboratories will have an eyewash station, safety shower, fume hood, a fire extinguisher, and a carrier for the safe transport of chemicals. Also know the location of the nearest emergency alarm.
    </p>
    <p>13. Be familiar with the experiment before beginning the lab. Pay particular attention to cautions given in the procedure and by the laboratory instructor. Learn about hazards associated with the chemicals you will be using by looking up and reading their Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Additionally, be aware of precautions to be taken with any special equipment you may be using.
    </p>
    <p>14. Work in the laboratory as if someone else is going to have an accident. Just because you are following all of the safety precautions doesn’t mean that your neighbor is!
    </p>
    <p>15. Read labels carefully. Only use the correct chemicals in the proper concentrations. The wrong chemical or concentration could result in a violent reaction.
    </p>
    <p>16. Ask “dumb” questions. If you are not sure about how to properly perform a procedure or handle a chemical, ask your instructor. Regardless of whatever preconceived notions you may have, asking questions does not make you look stupid, especially when safety is a concern!
    </p>
    <p>17. Don’t rush. If you are anxious to leave lab early or working hurriedly to catch up, you may neglect important safety precautions. Always make safety a priority.
    </p>
    <p>18. Label vials and flasks. If you do not label a vial and then forget what it contains, you will not know how to properly handle and dispose of its contents.
    </p>
    <p>19. Inform your instructor of any special medical conditions. If you have a medical condition that might be affected by laboratory work (e.g., allergies) or that might affect safe performance of laboratory work (e.g., seizure disorders), inform your instructor immediately. Additionally, students who are pregnant or breastfeeding must contact the instructor prior to the initiation of laboratory work. Chemicals used in the laboratory may be particularly harmful to developing fetuses and young infants.
    </p>
    <p>20. Know what to do in the event of an emergency. Prompt response to an incident can make the difference between a minor event and permanent injury. You should be familiar with actions to take in the event of an incident, as well as the location of the Student Health Center. In the event of an emergency, you can reach CSUB University Police from your cell phone by dialing (661) 654-2111 or from a campus phone by dialing 911 or extension 2111.
